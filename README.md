# General Description

[Course website here](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/fa20/)

- This repo contains all the labs, projects and homeworks in this course. I also add some notes and Testcodes of this course.  
To be honest, I'm really afraid whether I'll end up giving up studying all these CS stuffs at first, especially after I've been stuck after finishing week1 contents. Because I know I'm going to dig deeper into the actual machine, which might be boring. But after this entire night of finishing the contents of CS61C--week2, it feels like I'm really getting started in CS61C. I believe I can keep this inner-push and finish this course successfully!  
This long-lost enthusiasm in study really cheers me up.

- Now I'm ready for project2, and I find that the solutions of the discussions are already provided on the website lol. So from discussion 3, I'll just post the solutions of the discussions. And what's more, the starting file of the projects can be found on the introducing page of the project.  
  Due to the unmatched version of Venus, I choose to do the project2 of [CS61C Summer 2023](https://github.com/61c-teach/su23-proj2-starter).

## Some problems I failed to solve on my own

1. The set_bit function in Lab02. Whatever I do, I found I need to do some discussion based on different given v. But the thought in this question is pretty simple: **Don't care about what bit is in x, we just make that number to 0**, and keep all other bits of x unchanged. Using this tmp_result, we can modify the bit we want.
