# General Description

[Course website here](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/fa20/)
This repo contains all the labs, projects and homeworks in this course. I also add some notes and Testcodes of this course.  
To be honest, I'm really afraid whether I'll end up giving up studying all these CS stuffs at first, especially after I've been stucked after finishing week1 contents. Because I know I'm going to dig deeper into the actual machine, which might be boring. But after this entire night of finishing the contents of CS61C--week2, it feels like I'm really getting started in CS61C. I believe I can keep this inner-push and finish this course successfully!

This long-lost enthusiasm in study really cheers me up.
